# Real Time Detection of Common Objects in Thermal Images Integrated with Raspberry Pi Framework
The aim of the project is to use a cost-efficient Thermal Vision Camera in High-Speed Vehicles. Through Raspberry Pi and computer vision it should process its infrared video and pick out other vehicles, pedestrians and large animals, highlighting them on the video monitor. A potential danger to the vehicle can be detected by machine learning and deep learning algorithms and brought into notice of the driver by a beeping sound.

The project aims to decrease the accident rate in foggy and low-light conditions by providing a sharp, clear, real-time video of the road using a budget-friendly thermal camera.
